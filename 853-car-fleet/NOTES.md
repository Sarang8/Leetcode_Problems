Store the position of each car and the time taken to reach the target.
Sort them according to the start position. You cannot start them according to reach time as a car cannot overtake another car.
Any car which takes lesser time than the slowest car can join with the slowest car and form a fleet. Initially the last car is the slowest.
If a car takes more time than the slowest car then it cannot catch up with the last car, it now becomes the slowest car and forms a new fleet.
